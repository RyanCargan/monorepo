# Tips for Solving Coding Problems

## Problem Types

- **Search** Problems - Find something in the input that satisfies some property.
- **Structuring** Problems - Transform the input to satisfy some property.
- **Construction** Problems - Build something that satisfies some property.
- **Optimization** Problems - Find the thing that best satisfies some property.
- **Decision** Problems - Decide whether the input satisfies some property.
- **Adaptive** Problems - Preserve some property over time.

## Algorithmic Paradigms

### Brute Force

### Divide & Conquer

#### Dynamic Programming

Can be seen as a special case of divide & conquer.

Tasks
Execution Units
Processing Elements
Balance
Synchronization
Synchronicity
Race Conditions
Deadlocks
