# Testbed Frontend

Standard SPA combining stuff from a bunch of old projects in the form of subsites.
Detailed docs for each can be found over at my [website](https://codinghermit.net/) (WIP).

Planning to add SSR through the Vite bundler for better SEO for anything that gets past the prototyping stage.
Web crawlers can technically access SPAs but there are some limitations which make SSR optimal for SEO and other purposes.

Putting that off for later since I currently find SPAs easier to work with during the prototyping phase (for now) and I need to experiment with backends and auth mechanisms more.

I may develop an SSR starter site alongside this to grok the way it works before adding that functionality incrementally to my existing frontend.
