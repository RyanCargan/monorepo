# Study Notes

## Programming Constructs

You can boil down everything in a given program to these 3 concepts.

### Sequence

This refers to the program's control flow.

Relatively straightforward in most programs until some sort of (very) complex conditional logic (selection), concurrency or parallelism gets involved (or you use something like GOTOs for some reason).

### Selection

This refers to conditional logic that determines which of multiple (usually mutually-exclusive) paths a program's execution will take.

Can be boiled down to chaining boolean operators in some way (for the most part).

Can be identified by the presence of if statements, if-else ladders, switch statements or guard clauses.

### Iteration

This refers to constructs that will _repeat_ for a certain number of steps or until a certain condition is met.

Used when you need to search for, insert or delete something from a collection of data.

Can typically be handled at a low level of abstraction until & unless you have to deal with (traverse) a structure that is either nested (e.g. nested/multidimensional arrays, nested dictionaries, maps, objects etc.) or recursive (trees & graphs) in nature.

#### Raw/Low-Level Iteration Constructs

##### Loops

##### Recursive Callbacks

#### High-Level Iteration Constructs

##### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions (that return a function when executed, take a function as one or more of its arguments, or both) can help increase the level of abstraction in your code by making it more _declarative_.

###### (The Almighty) Reduce (a.k.a. _Fold/Accumulate/Aggregate/Compress/Inject_)

An important higher-order function that is built into the standard libraries of many programming languages including JavaScript, Python & C++ (including variant in the Thrust GPGPU API for CUDA & ROCm).

It's important since many other higher-order functions such as map and filter can be defined (for the program or for an explanation) in terms of it.

Can be implemented trivially (especially with generics) in languages that don't have it built in like Go.
