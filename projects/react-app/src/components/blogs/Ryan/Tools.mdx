# Tool Notes

Miscellaneous notes with reminders and tips on tools that I'm familiar with (or in the process of learning more thoroughly).

## Programming Tools

### Nix Package Manager

### GNU Make Build System

For the time being, it's mainly used by me for Go projects & certain types of C++ projects where using CMake causes issues.

### Visual Studio Code

### Emacs

### Vim/Neovim

## Language Specific Tools

### Go


### C++



#### CMake Meta Build System

CMake technically supports (to some extent) a large variety of languages but is typically used for C, C++, CUDA & Fortran projects and tends to have first-class support for those.

It's called a meta build system since it automatically generates, from a declarative CMakeLists.txt file, build files containing implementation details in some other lower-level build system (like Google's Ninja or GNU Make) or project files for IDEs like Visual Studio.
