# Polymorphism with Method Overloading & Overriding

## What are Method Overloading & Overriding

They can be thought of as techniques to reduce lines of code by allowing for different types of code reuse.

Contrasting polymorphism with inheritance can more context.

- Inheritance
  - **Data reuse**
  - Allows for reuse and extension of _class definitions_, creating new classes from old ones
  - Done via prototypal inheritance in JavaScript
- Polymorphism
  - **Behavior reuse**
  -  Allows for reuse of _methods_ via their application to _similar kinds of objects_
