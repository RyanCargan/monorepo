# Test-Driven Design

## What is TDD?
Automated tests for programs are common in software development because we want to have certain guarantees that introducing changes won't break existing functionality, and to make sure the changes do exactly what we expect (no more and no less) to the fullest degree feasible within a given timeframe.
<br />
Manually running the application (in a specific way) every time a minor change is made is wasteful of a developer's time.
<br />
At the same time the developer must have a fast cycle of feedback. Waiting for a quality assurance team member (assuming a QA team even exists as an option) to manually handle things is inefficient.
If the developer wants to remove that bottleneck they will have to periodically send changes in large batches which can make it trickier to narrow down where bugs are.
<br />
The best approach is for the developer to be able to quickly get certain guarantees about any new unit of behavior that is introduced.
Ideally in an automated (or at least semi-automated) way.
<br />
Test-driven design/development is an approach to testing where we write tests before the code itself. Not just to test it after the fact, but as a specification for future code that implements the functionality the test describes.

## Why use it?

### Improved code modularity
Code tends to be easier to manage if it's more modular and loosely coupled.

Such a program is composed of distinct parts which are independent and interchangeable to some extent.



### Clear task delegation
