# Study Notes

## Programming Constructs

You can boil down (almost?) everything in a given program to these 3 concepts.

### Sequence

This refers to the program's control flow.

Relatively straightforward in most programs until some sort of (very) complex conditional logic (selection), concurrency or parallelism gets involved (or you use something like GOTOs for some reason).

### Selection

This refers to conditional logic that determines which of multiple (usually mutually-exclusive) paths a program's execution will take.

Can be boiled down to chaining boolean operators in some way (for the most part).

Can be identified by the presence of if statements, if-else ladders, switch statements or guard clauses.

### Iteration

This refers to constructs that will _repeat_ for a certain number of steps or until a certain condition is met.

Used when you need to search for, insert or delete something from a collection of data.

Can typically be handled at a low level of abstraction until & unless you have to deal with (traverse) a structure that is either nested (e.g. nested/multidimensional arrays, nested dictionaries, maps, objects etc.) or recursive (trees & graphs) in nature.

#### Raw/Low-Level Iteration Constructs

##### Loops

`for`, `while`, `do ... while`, etc.

##### Recursive Callbacks

Can be used effectively in the form of tail recursion in languages that support tail-call optimization (e.g. C++, Scala & various Lisps).

Can lead to performance issues & potentially stack overflows (depending on the number of calls needed among other things) if used in the form of head recursion (or in any form for languages without TCO).

#### High-Level Iteration Constructs

##### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions (that return a function when executed, take a function as one or more of its arguments, or both) can help increase the level of abstraction in your code by making it more _declarative_.

- (The Almighty) Reduce (a.k.a. _Fold/Accumulate/Aggregate/Compress/Inject_)

  - An important higher-order function that is built into the standard libraries of many programming languages including JavaScript, Python & C++ (including a variant in the Thrust GPGPU API for CUDA & ROCm).

  - It's important since many other higher-order functions such as map and filter can be defined (for the program or for an explanation) in terms of it.

  - Can be implemented trivially (especially with generics) in languages that don't have it built in like Go.

## Mutability/Immutability

Immutable data is data that cannot be modified after creation, only copied and destroyed.

The concept becomes more important when dealing with concurrent systems and issues like race conditions.

### Splice vs. Slice

JavaScript's `splice()` function returns removed items from an array while `slice()` returns selected array elements as a new array object (while avoiding changes to the original). 

## Types of Design Problems

## Types of Implementation Problems

## Testing Solutions

### Test Kits

1. JavaScript & React - `jest` & `@testing-library/react`.

1. Go - `testing` package from the standard library.

1. C++ - `doctest`

### Coverage Tools

These give an easy automated way to see what percentage of your code base is covered by your tests. 

1. JavaScript - ?

1. Go - ?

1. C++ - ?

## Language Focus

### General-Purpose Languages

#### JavaScript

Garbage-collected dynamically-typed language using familiar C-inspired syntax with a mix of object-based (i.e. _prototype-based_) and functional concepts (no out-of-the-box classical inheritance, though prototypal inheritance is one of its main features).

Its `class` keyword is syntactic sugar over its constructor functions. Factory functions are preferred.

Limited standard library.

Lacks tail-call optimization in most implementations including the V8 engine which powers all Chromium-based browsers and Node.js.
The only exception seems to be JavaScriptCore (JSC) which powers the Safari browser on macOS and all browsers on iOS.

Higher-order functions like the built-in reduce preferred over raw recursive callbacks.

##### JavaScript Quirks

- Hoisting
  
  JS allows early functions to call functions declared later in a file.

  This extends to variable and class declaration too, _but not initializations._

#### Go

Garbage-collected statically-typed language with a focus on minimalism.

Suited for backend applications.

Good standard library.

Has good support for generics and type inference.

Uses for-loops for everything (more or less).

Rudimentary reduce function trivial to implement if needed.

#### C++

Language with manual memory management, static types and a focus on runtime performance.

Powerful standard library.

Has good support for generics (templates & concepts) and type inference (deduction).

Built-in reduce function with parallelism support (among many others).

### Special-Purpose Languages

Used in conjunction with the aforementioned general languages.

1. SQL

	Personal experience mainly in the form of PostgreSQL and occasionally SQLite for prototyping and client-side data management in some apps.

	Go's `sqlx` package provides a good inteface to it.

	Postgres also comes with some handy extensions:

	- PostGIS
	  - Geo-spatial data management functionality

	- TimescaleDB
	  - Time-series data handling with 'hypertables'

	- pgTAP
	  - SQL unit tests

	- Apache AGE
	  - Graph data management utilities
	  - Considered experimental as of the time of writing

1. Sass (SCSS)

	Superset of CSS (all valid CSS is valid SCSS) with added functionality to minimize boilerplate code.

	Used for styling in JavaScript projects.

1. CUDA (with Thrust API)
	GPGPU framework for C, C++ & Fortran.

### Unusual Languages

For experimentation more than anything else.

1. s7 Scheme

1. pForth

1. Netwide Assembly

## Common Pain Points

  - Solutions
    - State management libraries (e.g. Zustand for JavaScript)

- Concurrency & Parallelism

    - Resource access control (e.g. mutexes)

- Regressions
  - Solutions
    - Unit tests

## Programming Best Practices

### Test-First Development

The idea is to have tests act as a specification and encourage more modular code that is easier to isolate and reason about.

### Object-Oriented Design

A way to reduce complexity & mitigate risks in large software projects.

_Object-oriented programming_ has a variety of different meanings and definitions floating around these days.

Common themes in Alan Kay's original idea seem to be: decentralization, decoupling, loose coupling, modularity, and _risk mitigation_.

#### Techniques to Reduce Cognitive Load

- Abstraction
  - **Hiding information to enable easier reasoning about algorithms and data structures**
  - Allows for creating general abstract solutions that can be applied to many different types of concrete problems
- Encapsulation
  - **Controlling data access permissions with interfaces** (and making code self-documenting to some extent as a result)
  - Managing access control and imposing constraints which act as a form of implicit documentation
  - Done via closures & factory functions in JavaScript
    - Closures are functions that remember their outer variables when invoked in another scope (i.e. they 'enclose'/'latch onto' their initial outer scope to recall it when referenced in new scopes?)

    - Closures can help avoid redundant computation and preserve readability of code

#### Techniques to Reduce Lines of Code

These allow for different types of code reuse.

- Inheritance
  - **Data reuse**
  - Allows for reuse and extension of _class definitions_, creating new classes from old ones
  - Done via prototypal inheritance in JavaScript
- Polymorphism
  - **Behavior reuse**
  -  Allows for reuse of _methods_ via their application to _similar kinds of objects_

#### SOLID Principles

- S - ?
- O - ?
- L - ?
- I - Inversion of Control
  - Delegate decision-making to 'higher' levels of the system
  - _"Don't call us (higher-level components), we'll call you (lower-level components)."_
  - Implementable via:
    -  event loop, callbacks, or execute triggers
    -  constructor injection
    -  service locator pattern
- D - ?

#### Dependency Injection

TODO.

#### Domain-Driven Design

TODO.

### Data-Oriented Design

#### Locality of Reference

### Optimization

#### Profile-Guided Optimization

#### Branch Prediction Assistance

- `likely` & `unlikely` GCC macros

- Optimize impossible code branches away with something like C++23's `std::unreachable`
