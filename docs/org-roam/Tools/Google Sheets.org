Spreadsheets tend to be used for data storage and analysis in tabular format,
in place of something more sophisticated like a SQL database,
unless the data gets to a certain scale and enough specialists are available.

Specialized solutions tend to be overkill for basic accounting,
report generation and similar functions common in most departments in a company.
The relatively low skill floor needed to use spreadsheets effectively make them very applicable and appealing.
