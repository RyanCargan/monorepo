* Current Plan
Already using JavaScript for frontend work and Go for backend work.
Looking to use LeetCode-style problems as a way to get more familiar with C++ (and possibly s7).
Gforth is in the backburner for now.
** Current Focus
- Categorizing different common data structures and algorithms that appear in coding problems.
- Graph traversal algorithms
