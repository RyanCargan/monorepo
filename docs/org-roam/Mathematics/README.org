:ID:       21268244-aef8-4508-bea7-3083221aff2d
:END:
Generally a review of [[Algebra 1]] & [[Algebra 2]] with a few concepts added from trigonometry and possibly [[Linear Algebra]] like matrices to prepare for [[Calculus]].
*** Calculus
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1ec59a67-0773-46a0-8047-06a643c7c1d8
:END:
** Section 2
*** Multivariable Calculus
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
*** Differential Equations
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b4351787-f1ee-4979-9f53-02b27ba522be
:END:
Might want to skip ahead to [[Linear Algebra]] for a bit as it can make learning this topic easier.
** Section 3
*** Linear Algebra
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8c1d3f9b-b2d4-429f-925c-78b78bfd3792
:END:
Expands on ideas like systems of equations and generalizing it as a theory.
Makes learning [[Differential Equations]] easier.
*** Abstract Algebra
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6cc617c0-5b2a-43cf-a5fa-be6bd7907dfc
:END:
Studies mathematical objects such as groups and rings which can be seen as generalizations of number systems.
*** Galois Theory
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       53d7bcb8-4d64-47be-b329-a6eee88a4fff
:END:
Provides methods to reduce problems in field theory to problems in group theory.
** Section 4
*** Real Analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       37afe56f-1e6c-41f6-a4a6-f2570f966844
:END:
Can be seen as a more rigorous revisit of concepts learned in Calculus.
